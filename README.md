General Robot Framework tests to verify the Job Application process.

For the tests to work, the variables.py file should be filled correctly and the correct files should be included in the 'Profile' folder unless the test is being executed using the incorrect file formats.

For the data driven testing, seperate robot file can be created. The existing keywords can be used as the test template.
